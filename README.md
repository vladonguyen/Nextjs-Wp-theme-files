These files extend the functionality of the Twenty Twenty-Two WordPress theme to work seamlessly as a headless CMS in conjunction with Next.js.

## Note

This code is based on the course [Next JS & WordPress: Build rapid NextJS sites with Next & WP](https://www.udemy.com/course/next-js-wordpress/). However, it might be inspiring to somebody working on WordPress child themes used as headless CMS with Next.js. In case you need to go more in depth, I recommend you to watch the course.
